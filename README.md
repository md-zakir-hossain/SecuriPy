# SecuriPy
SecuriPy — FastAPI Web Security Risk Checker.  SecuriPy is a lightweight FastAPI service that checks public websites for common security headers and cookie flags, then applies a tiny machine learning model to estimate risk. It’s non-intrusive (uses HEAD/GET requests only) and safe to run on sites you own or have permission to test.
